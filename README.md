# Emotion recognition dataset
This repo contains voices extracted from Persian movies. Extracted voices classified into 4 separate 
categories by human. I obtained these voices from Dr. Muharram Mansoorizadeh from University of Hamedan.
This dataset is created by one of the Dr. Mansoorzadeh's sudents.
Finaly, I converted the dataset to 8000 Hz samples.
